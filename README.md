This is an open source [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project. Our mission is to create the world's largest online ~~slack-off~~ lunch break community. We’re all about embracing the art of the midday reset — sometimes, the most productive thing you can do is step away from your screen for a while and daydream about that perfect weekend getaway or your favorite Netflix series.

## More than Slack-Off 🧠

We firmly believe that taking a breather is key to conquering your afternoon workload like a boss. Rebalance, refresh, and return with the energy of a thousand (well, maybe a hundred) coffees. Whether it's planning your next culinary adventure, trading hilarious cat memes, or sharing your latest hobby, this is the place to do it.

## Don’t piss off your boss 😈

But hey, we're not encouraging endless loafing around! To keep things balanced and productive, each user is limited to one hour of fun per day. Once you've hit your limit, you’ll be gently redirected to a random educational website — and in case you left too long😏

## How to join the fun 🏄‍♂️

Interested in being part of the coolest slacker crew around? Simply reach out to our project admin and snag yourself an invite. We welcome contributions, be they ideas, code, or even just really great snack recommendations.
